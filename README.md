# Orion Swap Intro

### We are OrionSwap! Hunters of Starfields and explorers of Galaxy Pools! Come join the newest and most exciting AMM on the Binance Smart Chain!

## ↔️ Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

### Low fees

Why pay more? We can say that we have the lowest trading fees, period. Traders pay a .18% fee on every swap. That's lower than anyone on the Binance Smart Chain or the Ethereum network!!

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app. Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, OrionSwap doesn’t hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.

## 💰 Stack Starfields!!

Starfields are OrionSwap's platform token. You can earn them by locking your liquidity tokens in a farm or by staking your tokens in Galaxy Pools.

### Earn tokens with Galaxy Pools

Stake Starfields or other tokens in our Galaxy pools and earn more Starfields. It’s really that easy.

### Earn Starfields with Yield Farms

Stake OrionSwap LP tokens, earn Starfields. You take on a little more exposure to market fluctuations than with the Galaxy Pools, but can earn higher APR to offset the risk.

### Earn Trading Fees

No yield farm? No problem. Even if your trading pair isn’t supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools \(Orion LPs\).

## Is it safe?

All of our contracts were forked from PancakeSwap, which means they are battle tested. We made the minimal changes necessary for our purposes and fixed some major issues in the original contracts. Certifications and Audits are pending.

Check out our diffs to see exactly what we changed. For our factory and our router contracts, we only changed strings to Orion. Our pair contract had a bunch of name changes but we also removed flashloan logic and updated our fee structure.
