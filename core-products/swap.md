# Swap

The OrionSwap Automated Market Maker offers several features that support decentralized trading:

### Swapping/Trading

OrionSwap lets users trade without the need to go through a Centralized Exchange. Everything you do on OrionSwap is routed directly through your own wallet—no need to trust someone else with your coins!

### Fees

When you swap tokens on OrionSwap you will pay a **0.18% fee**, which is broken down as follows:

**0.165%** - Returned to Liquidity Pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.

**0.015%** - Sent to the PancakeSwap Treasury.

### Liquidity Pools

The OrionSwap AMM can only operate when there's enough liquidity to support trades. However, the engine is smart enough to find intermediate trades and will always look for the best path to get the best trade. If you want to swap Starfield with BTCB, for example, and that pair doesn't exist, OrionSwap will look for other common pairs that include Starfield and BTCB. So if each of those has a pair that allows them to be traded with BNB, then OrionSwap will route your trade from Starfield to BNB to BTCB!

As we said, our AMM can only operate if people provide liquidity. When they do, they will get a percentage ownership of the liquidity pool in the form of Liquidity Pool tokens. Those tokens represent their share of the tokens in the liquidity pool. When people trade between the two tokens in a pool, OrionSwap charges a trading fee and passes the majority of that fee back to the liquidity providers. 

### How Liquidity Pool Earnings Are Calculated

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.  
[“Simply put, impermanent loss is the difference between holding tokens in an AMM and holding them in your wallet.” - Nate Hindman](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)

It’s not all bad for liquidity providers as you will also be given a reward in the form of trading fees. Whenever someone trades on OrionSwap, the trader pays a fee, of which 0.165% is added to the Liquidity Pool of the swap pair they traded on. 

For example:

* There are 10 LP tokens representing 10 Starfields and 10 BNB tokens.
* Each LP token is worth 1 Starfield and 1 BNB
* Someone trades 10 Starfields for 10 BNB.
* Someone else trades 10 BNB for 10 Starfields.
* The Starfield/BNB liquidity pool now has 10.0165 Starfields and 10.0165 BNB.
* Each LP token is now worth 1.000165 Starfields and 1.000165 BNB.

### Earn Even More!

To make being a liquidity provider even more worth while, you can also put your LP tokens to work in our Farms and earn Starfields while still earning your 0.165% trading fee reward. But that isn't where it stops! You can then take the Starfields you earned and put them in our Galaxy pool to earn even more, you guessed it!!! STARFIELDS!!!
